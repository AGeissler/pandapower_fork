    "In power flow analysis, a slack bus is chosen which compensates the mismatch of active power in the grid as related to the balance of consumption, generation and losses. This mismatch results from grid losses or an unbalanced dispatch. In real transmission and distribution systems, multiple generators can play a role in compensating the mismatch of active power. The approach of _distributed slack_ allows to model the allocation of the mismatch compensation to a number of buses according to pre-defined weights, which more closely resembles real-world scenarios. To describe how much active power a single element contributes to the compensation of the mismatch of active power, the parameter *slack_weight* is used. \n",

    "In pandapower, the load flow calculation with Newton-Raphson algorithm supports the functionality of distributed slack. To this end, the user can set the argument *distributed_slack* to True when calling the function runpp. The slack weights for *ext_grid*, *gen* and *xward* elements should be provided in the *slack_weight* column."

    "The sum of all slack weights of the contributing elements should be 1 and must be greater than 0. If the sum of the slack weights is other than 1, it is normalized to 1 before the load flow calculation. If the net has exactly one slack, e.g. an ext_grid, and only this element has a slack_weight other than 0, a load flow calculation considering distributed slack will have the same results as a load flow calculation without using the distributed slack (details in the first example below)."
